# Improvisational UI space

So. Here is just a list of the ui components which will be extended with time.
All the styles are stored inside the single `.css` file in root. Everything will be separated later, when this sturtup will shine. ðŸ¤£

In terms of the content. For now here is just a necessary stuff for a login page. ðŸ˜Š

## Box

This is kinda `div` wrapper for a form controls.

## Button

Common button. You can click it and see loading state.

## LinkButton

WIP still. Was intended for the "forgot password" action.
