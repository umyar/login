# login page

Just a login page on React. You can find out my front-end skills here. ðŸ™‚

Key points:
1) Dummy BE is also implemented by me. Just checking a couple of hardcoded email-password pairs.
2) This app is just a login page. In root. No any other pages.
3) Work is still in progress. Ideal state is not achievable...
